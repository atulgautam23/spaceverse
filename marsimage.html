   <P> <b>Tracks Tell Tale of Perseverance’s Crater Rim Climb</b>
    One of the navigation cameras aboard NASA’s Perseverance captured this image of the tracks made by the rover during its climb up the rim of Jezero Crater on Oct. 11, 2024, the 1,295th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

        The rover’s tracks, seen disappearing into the distance, have churned up the regolith (broken rock and sand) on the surface, indicating high slip. The edges of the tracks are not straight or smooth, which indicates cross-track sliding during the drive. On less slippery terrain, the tracks have well defined lines from the grousers on the rover wheels.
        
        The distant river channel seen at the upper left of image is Neretva Vallis, which fed Jezero Crater with fresh water billions of years ago. </P>

   <p> <b>Perseverance Finds a Rock with ‘Leopard Spots’</b>
    NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover captured this image of a rock nicknamed “Cheyava Falls” on July 18, 2024, the 1,212th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. Running the length of the rock are large white calcium sulfate veins. Between those veins are bands of material whose reddish color suggests the presence of hematite, one of the minerals that gives Mars its distinctive rusty hue. Scientists are particularly interested in the millimeter-size, irregularly shaped light patches on the central reddish band (from lower left to upper right of the image) that are surrounded by a thin ring of dark material, akin to leopard spots. Spotting of this type on sedimentary terrestrial rocks can occur when chemical reactions involving hematite turn the rock from red to white. Those reactions can also release iron and phosphate, possibly causing the black halos to form, and they can be an energy source for microbes, hence the association between such features and microbes in a terrestrial setting.

   <p> <b>Perseverance’s Climb to ‘Witch Hazel Hill’</b>
    The route (shown in blue) that the agency’s Perseverance Mars rover is expected to take as it climbs up the western rim of Jezero Crater is superimposed on this image taken by the HiRISE camera aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
    At upper right is “Serpentine Rapids,” the final geologic location of interest for the Perseverance science team before the rover begins its ascent. “Dox Castle” is a region the science team would like to explore during the rover’s ascent. Two of the first regions the science team wants study at the top of the crater are “Pico Turquino” and “Witch Hazel Hill.”

  <p> <b>Perseverance Looks Back at ‘Bright Angel’</b>
    One of the navigation cameras aboard NASA’s Perseverance rover captured this view as the rover left the “Bright Angel” area of Mars’ Jezero Crater on July 30, 2024, the 1,224th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.
    A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust)

  <p><b>Perseverance’s Selfie With ‘Cheyava Falls’</b>
    NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover took this selfie on July 23, 2024, the 1,218th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. To the left of the rover near the center of the image is the arrowhead-shaped rock nicknamed “Cheyava Falls,” which has features that may bear on the question of whether Mars was home to microscopic life in the distant past. The small dark hole in the rock is where Perseverance took a core sample, which is now in a sample tube stored in the rover’s belly. The white patch to the right of the hole is where the rover used an abrasion tool to clear away the top surface, allowing science instruments to study the rock’s composition.

  <p><b>NASA's Webb Reveals Unusual Jets of Volatile Gas from Icy Centaur 29P (Artist's Concept)</b>
  This animation shows NASA's Perseverance Mars rover collecting a sample from a rock the science team calls "Bunsen Peak" using a coring bit on the end of its robotic arm. It was the 21st rock core collected by Perseverance, and the 24th sample overall for the mission. The sample was collected on March 12, 2024, the 1,088th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

    The 33 images that make up this animation were taken by one of the rover's front hazard cameras. The animation has been sped up by 390 times.</p>

 <p> <b> Perseverance Drives Backward Up Jezero Crater’s Rim</b>
  NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover drove first backward then forward as it negotiated some slippery terrain found along a route up the rim of Jezero Crater that the science team calls “Summerland Trail.” The 31 images used to create this video were acquired by one of the rover’s navigation cameras on Oct. 15, 2024, the 1,299th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

  A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust).

 <p><b>Perseverance Captures ‘Bright Angel’ in 360 Degrees</b>
  NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover used its Mastcam-Z instrument to capture this 360-degree view of a region on Mars called “Bright Angel,” where an ancient river flowed billions of years ago. The panorama was captured on June 12, 2024, the 1,178th Martian day, or sol, of the mission, and is made up of 346 individual images that were stitched together after being sent back to Earth. The color has been enhanced to bring out subtle details.

It was not far from here that the rover took a sample at a rock dubbed “Cheyava Falls,” finding one of the most exciting discoveries of the mission thus far. Cheyava Falls is slightly right of center, about 361 feet (110 meters) from the rover.

Also visible is Perseverance itself, though not all of the rover was imaged in this panorama. The rover’s mast, or “head,” is visible in silhouette at bottom center.
